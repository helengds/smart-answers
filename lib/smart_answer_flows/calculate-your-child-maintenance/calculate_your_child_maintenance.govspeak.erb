  Calculate your child maintenance
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>

  You can use this calculator to estimate your child maintenance. It can help you to:

  * agree an amount with the other parent if [you’re arranging it yourselves](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself)
  * get an idea of the amount the government would work out for you

  ^<%= render partial: 'disclaimer.govspeak.erb' %>^
<% end %>

<% content_for :post_body do %>
  You need information about the income of the parent who'll be paying.

  ##If you already have a case and your circumstances have changed

  If you have a child maintenance case and your circumstances have changed, [contact the office managing your case](/child-maintenance/contact). They’ll tell you if your child maintenance payments will change.

  Don't use the calculator if you have a ['1993 scheme' or '2003 scheme' case](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/child-maintenance-before-march-2003). These are managed by the [Child Support Agency](/child-maintenance/contact) (CSA).
