Student finance calculator

This calculator is for students from England or the European Union (EU) starting a new course in academic years:

+ 2016 to 2017
+ 2017 to 2018

^There will be no change to the [rights and status of EU nationals living in the UK, nor UK nationals living in the EU](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-leaving-the-eu-what-you-need-to-know), while the UK remains in the EU.^

Use the student finance calculator to estimate:

+ student loans
+ extra student funding, eg if you’re disabled or have children

Your result will be more accurate if you know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).


You can’t use the calculator if you’re from [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/), [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk) or [Northern Ireland.](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk)
